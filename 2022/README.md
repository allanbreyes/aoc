# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Usage

### Scaffold a day

```sh
# example: `cargo scaffold 1`
cargo scaffold <day>

# output:
# Created module "src/bin/01.rs"
# Created empty input file "src/inputs/01.txt"
# Created empty example file "src/examples/01.txt"
# ---
# ðŸŽ„ Type `cargo solve 01` to run your solution.
```

Individual solutions live in the `./src/bin/` directory as separate binaries.

Every [solution](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust/blob/main/src/bin/scaffold.rs#L11-L41) has _unit tests_ referencing its _example_ file. Use these unit tests to develop and debug your solution against the example input. For some puzzles, it might be easier to forgo the example file and hardcode inputs into the tests.

When editing a solution, `rust-analyzer` will display buttons for running / debugging unit tests above the unit test blocks.

### Run solutions for a day

```sh
# example: `cargo solve 01`
cargo solve <day>

# output:
#     Running `target/debug/01`
# ðŸŽ„ Part 1 ðŸŽ„
#
# 6 (elapsed: 37.03Âµs)
#
# ðŸŽ„ Part 2 ðŸŽ„
#
# 9 (elapsed: 33.18Âµs)
```

`solve` is an alias for `cargo run --bin`. To run an optimized version for benchmarking, append the `--release` flag.

Displayed _timings_ show the raw execution time of your solution without overhead (e.g. file reads).

### Run all solutions

```sh
cargo all

# output:
#     Running `target/release/advent_of_code`
# ----------
# | Day 01 |
# ----------
# ðŸŽ„ Part 1 ðŸŽ„
#
# 0 (elapsed: 170.00Âµs)
#
# ðŸŽ„ Part 2 ðŸŽ„
#
# 0 (elapsed: 30.00Âµs)
# <...other days...>
# Total: 0.20ms
```

`all` is an alias for `cargo run`. To run an optimized version for benchmarking, use the `--release` flag.

_Total timing_ is computed from individual solution _timings_ and excludes as much overhead as possible.

### Run all solutions against the example input

```sh
cargo test
```

To run tests for a specific day, append `--bin <day>`, e.g. `cargo test --bin 01`. You can further scope it down to a specific part, e.g. `cargo test --bin 01 part_one`.

### Format code

```sh
cargo fmt
```

### Lint code

```sh
cargo clippy
```

## Optional template features

### Enable clippy lints in CI

Uncomment the `clippy` job in the `ci.yml` workflow to enable clippy checks in CI.

### Use VS Code to debug your code

1.  Install [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) and [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb).
2.  Set breakpoints in your code. [^3]
3.  Click _Debug_ next to the unit test or the _main_ function. [^4]
4.  The debugger will halt your program at the specific line and allow you to inspect the local stack. [^5]

## Useful crates

-   [itertools](https://crates.io/crates/itertools): Extends iterators with extra methods and adaptors. Frequently useful for aoc puzzles.
-   [regex](https://crates.io/crates/regex): Official regular expressions implementation for Rust.

## Common pitfalls

-   **Integer overflows:** This template uses 32-bit integers by default because it is generally faster - for example when packed in large arrays or structs - than using 64-bit integers everywhere. For some problems, solutions for real input might exceed 32-bit integer space. While this is checked and panics in `debug` mode, integers [wrap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow) in `release` mode, leading to wrong output when running your solution.
